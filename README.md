This api will use a relational database to store and query the statistics of baseball players, past and present, with avaiable game data. This includes at-bats, hits, balls, and games played for baseball players. We will be able to use the api to add new games to the dataset as they are played to compute updated values for batting averages and on-base percentage for current players as the season progresses.
