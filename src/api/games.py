    This endpoint takes in two lineup objects and returns a simulated game object. A lineup consists of:
    * `team_id`: The internal id of the team. Can be used to query the `/view_roster/{team_id}` endpoint.
    * `lineup`: A list of exactly 10 player_ids (0 is the designated hitter, 1-9 are in batting order).

    This endpoint returns a game object. This game object calculates a random game based on a playerâ€™s given stats. This consists of:
    * `winner`: The team id of the winning team.
    * `loser`: The team id of the losing team.
    * `score`: The ending score of the game.
    * `play_by_play`: A list of event objects that occurred in the game.

    Each event is represented by a dictionary with the following keys:
    * `inning`: The inning of the game.
    * `T/B` Top/Bottom of inning.
    * `player`: Player name of batter.
    * `happening`: What the player did. Some examples include Walk, Strikeout, Home Run, etc.
